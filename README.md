# Predicting Housing Prices for a Real Estate Investment Trust
## Introduction
In this assignment, I am a Data Analyst working for a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust has tasked me with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. My job is to analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.
To achieve this, I will be utilizing JupyterLab running on the Cloud in Skills Network Labs environment. A template notebook has been provided for me to complete ten questions, with some hints given in the notebook.

## Dataset Used in this Assignment
