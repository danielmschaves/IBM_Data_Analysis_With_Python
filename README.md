# Predicting Housing Prices for a Real Estate Investment Trust
## Introduction
In this assignment, I am a Data Analyst working for a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust has tasked me with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. My job is to analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.
To achieve this, I will be utilizing JupyterLab running on the Cloud in Skills Network Labs environment. A template notebook has been provided for me to complete ten questions, with some hints given in the notebook.

## Dataset Used in this Assignment
The dataset used in this assignment contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The dataset was taken from here, and was slightly modified for the purposes of this course.

## Conclusion
With the completion of this assignment, the Real Estate Investment Trust will have the necessary information to start investing in Residential real estate. I am excited to use my skills to help them make informed decisions and achieve their goals.
